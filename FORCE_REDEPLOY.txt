Railway deployment issue: Fix Dash 3.x (commit 88a86dd) nu e activ pe server.
Asset timestamp shows rebuild: v3_0_5m1763224319 (newer than fix deployment).

Forțăm redeploy prin modificare fișier trigger.

Expected fix in wsgi.py line 151:
```python
from dash import html, dcc, dash_table  # ✅ Dash 3.x CORRECT
```

Browser error (CURRENT):
```
GET dash_html_components.v3_0_5m1763224319.min.js → 500
Error: dash_html_components was not found
```

This file triggers Railway rebuild with correct code from master branch.
